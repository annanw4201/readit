# Notes
- Created and managed the web app using MVC (Model, View, Controller) architecture. In this web app integrating with Express:
  - Models are part where we save information needed and define their behaviors in databse. (Database)
  - Views are pages that users to interact with. (Browser)
  - Controllers are part where they can bring and take information between models and views. (Server)

- We won't store data on local machine, use DataBase-as-a-Service (DBaas) called 'mLab' instead:
  - It provides us with simplicities to setup database
  - It provides us with the Graphic Interface to look around the database

- Used mongodb, and integrated mongoose, an ODM (Object Database Manager) for making life easier to write tedious, error-prone and repetitive database code.
